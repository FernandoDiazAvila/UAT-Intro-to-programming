<!--                        Fernando Diaz Avila's assignment
    Planning: 
    How do I want this to look like?
        Centered with bigger numbers and the Logo UAT space program with a grey background.
    
    What Do I need to have?
        I need the doctype declaration to be html
        (I can begin with an empty HTML shell the the >>! + tab button trick Mr. Hamilton taught the class)
        I will also need the HTML tags, head tags, title tags and text, body tags, header tags and text, paragraph tags and and alert.
        (These extra tags that dont come along with the shell I can type, and read the course materials to find functions to make the countdown work)
    
    What can I do to make it better next time?
        (I can figure out to make the coundown automatic after pressing the button once. I should check out WWW3 schools to look looping)

        ***<p> var countdown </p>***
        Here I pressumed the code to desplay the variable countdown when on line 39 I created the 
        variable an ID and instructed the program to get the element by its ID instead of its variable name--> 
        
        <p id="DisplayCountDown"></p>
        <p id="DisplayBlastOff" ></p>
        <button id="b" onclick = "RunCountDown()"> Launch</button>
    </body>
    
<!--Reviewing code as <p id= "DisplayCountdown"> tag aren't displaying.
    Now I understand by the program bing case sensitive. The ID tag for DisplayCountDown didnt match in the <p> tag. 
    Issue was resolved by correcty
